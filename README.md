## Welcome to Dr. Vijay Kumar Homepage

Currently I am doing my Post-Doctoral Research in Hebrew University of Jerusamel and jointly working as a Visiting Scientist with [Prof. Victor Stenberg](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/steinberg/home) in Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. 

We are studying fluid dynamics to see the intability on Non-Newtonian fluid/Visco-elastic fluid. The elastic instability is observed even in very samll [Reynolds number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number) and [Weissenberg number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Weissenberg)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mvijay1985/Vijay-Kumar/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mvijay1985/Vijay-Kumar/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
