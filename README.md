## Welcome to Dr. Vijay Kumar Homepage

Currently I am doing my Post-Doctoral Research in Hebrew University of Jerusalem and jointly working as a Visiting Scientist with [Prof. Victor Stenberg](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/steinberg/home) in Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. 

We are studying fluid dynamics to see the intability on Non-Newtonian fluid/Visco-elastic fluid. The elastic instability is observed even in very samll [Reynolds number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number) and [Weissenberg number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Weissenberg)
